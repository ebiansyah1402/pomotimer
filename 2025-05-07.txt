[09:25:33] Trying Gemini-made script of pomodoro timer. This thing need a noice when it's done, so when the terminal is in the background, it still gives me a notification that pomodoro is done
[09:40:54] Trying the one with notification sound. This work.
[10:12:58] Ok, this work. I need to try what happened if I tried to put 2 pomodoro cycle. The code suggest it can handle fragmented time (as in anything less than 15 minutes)
[12:21:54] first cycle work beutfiully
[12:25:13] second cycle work equally perfect
[20:05:48] corecting some of the file name in generated code by Gemini
[20:10:11] prompt gemini to be awesome
[20:14:52] just another test run
[20:17:21] still doing test run. I'd like for this sound to keep playing
[20:25:53] nothing, it doesn't result in the outcome I want
[20:31:40] 
[20:34:00] trying to figure out how to make the sound looping
[20:39:21] The sound now looping
[20:42:31] sucsessfully playing the sound on a loop without deprication warning
